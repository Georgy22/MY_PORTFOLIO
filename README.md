# MY_PORTFOLIO

This portfolio displays some sample of my work with links to each project, especially the alx project where I built a registration form that collects users' data and sends to a receiver, using formspree.com.
I use netlify for my deployments. The registration form is a small project that I did myself using just html and css as they are the only languages I'm familiar with at the moment. I'm hoping to build more robust projects using programming languages later on in the future when I'm fully proficient with either of the languages.

The project was done with the help of google and some of my cohort members e.g Afolabi Seun.

Thanks!
